    <p>
        Imagine a light fluffy pancake, skillet fried in a little butter, with gorgeous, sweet blueberries throughout, topped with a healthy drizzle of maple syrup. Seriously, does breakfast food get any better? These pancakes are golden and lightly crisp at the edges, with a soft, tender center. Blueberry Pancakes with fresh blueberries are most definitely not just for special occasions! The baking powder in this pancake recipe is what makes them so fluffy!

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>1+ cup fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>more butter for the pan</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the milk and vinegar and let it sit for a minute or two (you’re making “buttermilk” here).</li>
            <li>Whisk the dry ingredients together. Whisk the egg, milk, and melted butter into the dry ingredients until just combined.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Melt a little smear of butter in the pan (essential for giving a yummy golden brown crust).
            </li>
            <li>Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the hot skillet and spread it flat-like (it will be pretty thick). Arrange a few blueberries on top. Cook until you see little bubbles on top and the edges starting to firm up. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the pancakes are sky-high fluffy and cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>Serve with butter and maple syrup. But honestly, sometimes I just like to eat these plain. YUM, YUM, YUM.</li>
        </ol>
